# Simple Page structured using react

this is to teach the basics of creating a project using react(and vite).

1. the React components of the webpage are in the folder called components

2. icons and pictures for the webapp are saved assets folder, and imported into js as and when required

3. index.html file contains the basic rendering structure, and runs the file

4. app.jsx contains the high-level breakdown of the app where the components are imported and added

5. app.css contains all the styling added to the app (via classes only)
